<h1>Contributing to Chart.js</h1>

<p>Contributions to Chart.js are welcome and encouraged, but please have a look through the guidelines in this document before raising an issue, or writing code for the project.</p>

<h2>Using issues</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/issues">issue tracker</a> is the preferred channel for reporting bugs, requesting new features and submitting pull requests.</p>

<p>If you’re suggesting a new chart type, please take a look at <a href="https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/06-Advanced.md#writing-new-chart-types">writing new chart types</a> in the documentation, and some of the <a href="https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/06-Advanced.md#community-extensions">community extensions</a> that have been created already.</p>

<p>To keep the library lightweight for everyone, it’s unlikely we’ll add many more chart types to the core of Chart.js, but issues are a good medium to design and spec out how new chart types could work and look.</p>

<p>Please do not use issues for support requests. For help using Chart.js, please take a look at the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chartjs"><code>chartjs</code></a> tag on Stack Overflow.</p>

<h2>Reporting bugs</h2>

<p>Well structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project.</p>

<p>Guidlines for reporting bugs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported</li>
  <li>Isolate the problem to a simple test case</li>
  <li>Provide a demonstration of the problem on <a href="http://jsbin.com">JS Bin</a> or similar</li>
</ul>

<p>Please provide any additional details associated with the bug, if it’s browser or screen density specific, or only happens with a certain configuration or data.</p>

<h2>Pull requests</h2>

<p>Clear, concise pull requests are excellent at continuing the project’s community driven growth. But please review <a href="https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request">these guidelines</a> and the guidelines below before starting work on the project.</p>

<p>Guidlines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please create an issue first:
    <ul>
      <li>For bugs, we can discuss the fixing approach</li>
      <li>For enhancements, we can discuss if it is within the project scope and avoid duplicate effort</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Please make changes to the files in <a href="https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/tree/master/src"><code>/src</code></a>, not <code>Chart.js</code> or <code>Chart.min.js</code> in the repo root directory, this avoids merge conflicts</li>
  <li>Tabs for indentation, not spaces please</li>
  <li>If adding new functionality, please also update the relevant <code>.md</code> file in <a href="https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/tree/master/docs"><code>/docs</code></a></li>
  <li>Please make your commits in logical sections with clear commit messages</li>
</ul>
